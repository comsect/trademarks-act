### Withdrawal of acceptance

Where, after the acceptance of an application for registration of a trade mark but before its registration, the Registrar is satisfiedâ€”
<ol class="outer-list">
<li> that the application has been accepted in error; or</li>
<li> that in the circumstances of the case the trade mark should not be registered or should be registered subject to conditions or limitations or to conditions additional to or different from the conditions or limitations subject to which the application has been accepted, the Registrar may, after hearing the applicant if he so desires, withdraw the acceptance and proceed as if the application had not been accepted.</li>
</ol>
